## Research Interests

**1. AI in Healthcare**
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">  
- My research focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to detect both physical and mental health conditions early. The goal is to prevent diseases before they arise, halt their progression, and reduce complications for patients who are already affected.
</div>  

**2. Biomedical Signal and Image Processing**
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">   
- Working with signals (e.g., ECG, EEG) and medical images (e.g., MRI, CT) to extract features and develop ML models for real-time monitoring, diagnosis, and deeper understanding of medical conditions.
</div>


**3. Interpretable & Trustworthy AI:**
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;"> 
- Designing methods that make AI decision-making clear and reliable so that clinicians and patients can use them with confidence.
</div>

**4. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Multi-modal Learning**
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;"> 
- Experienced in dataset creation (collection, annotation, and curation) and fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. Interested in extending
this expertise to multi-modal medical applications by integrating text, images, and signals for deeper understanding of complex conditions.
